It is recommended to create a new user for Winlogbeat instead of using the `elastic` user for the following reasons:
1. **Least Privilege**: The `elastic` user is a superuser with broad permissions. Creating a dedicated user with restricted permissions reduces security risks in case of a compromise.
2. **Role Segregation**: Separating roles prevents a single user from having excessive powers, enhancing security.
3. **Tracking and Auditing**: Separate users make it easier to monitor and audit the specific activities of Winlogbeat.
4. **Security Management**: Using the `elastic` user in various parts increases the risk of credential exposure. A dedicated user reduces the impact of potential leaks.
